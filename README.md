# Currency-Converter
A Currency Converter HTML project is a web application that allows users to convert one currency to another. The user can input the amount of money they want to convert and select the currencies they want to convert from and to. The application then displays the converted amount based on the current exchange rate.

The project involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface that is easy to use and visually appealing. The HTML code will be used to structure the layout of the web page, while CSS will be used to style the page and make it look attractive. JavaScript will be used to handle the currency conversion calculations and update the display in real-time.

The project will require the use of an API to fetch the current exchange rates for the selected currencies. The API will be integrated into the JavaScript code to retrieve the exchange rates and perform the currency conversion calculations.

Overall, the Currency Converter HTML project is a great way to learn about web development and APIs. It is also a useful tool for anyone who needs to convert currencies on a regular basis.
